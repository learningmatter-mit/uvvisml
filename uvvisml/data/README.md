## Manifest

* `computed/`: contains data computed by TD-DFT
* `original/`: original experimental datasets downloaded from sources above
* `processed/`: data from `original/` that has been processed by `data_organization_and_cleaning_lambda_max_abs.py`
* `splits/`: data from computed and experimental properties split into train, validation, and test sets by `create_splits.py`
* `README.md`: this file
* `create_splits.py`: creates train, validation, and test splits using random, group-by-SMILES, or scaffold splits
* `data_organization_and_cleaning_lambda_max_abs.py`: processes data from `original/` and exports it to `processed/`
* `scaffold_splits.py`: used by `create_splits.py` if scaffold splits are chosen
